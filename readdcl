%% Other versions

pxpymonobp1.m:reference images are the mono multispectral images in strip files
pxpymono.m: reference images are the panchormatic orthoimage strip files.For the mono image of strip, make sure to use its own strip orthoimage as reference.
pxpymonobp2.m:reference images not fixed to its own strip files. Not used.

multispecstripbp1.m: assume mono image aligned to strip DEM, which turns out can be off by 2 m.
multispecstrip.m: use the translational parameters to align mono image to the strip DEM.

multispecmonobp1.m: use the mean of land mean and ocean mean.


Note:
1\ cp ~/chunliwork/river/riverpic/run2/gageflagyx/gageheights_test.m widthgageprof.m
2\ (April 2019) For future versions, may need to manually set rangeov=[] in ChangeRiver.m to avoid cropping of image.
3\ The parallel of pxpymono.m is tested in /home/dai.56/chunliwork/river/riverpic/riverwork2/2/testparel, which differs from resutls of serial computation by only 1e-13. Nevertheless, the computation has warnings like gdal_translate interputted.
4\ For Debug log see /home/dai.56/chunliwork/river/riverpic/run2/readdcl
5\ The parallel of ChangeRiver.m (ChangeRiverbp4par.m) is tested in chunliwork/river/riverpic/run2/runparal, but failed.
