Input orthoimage data type : double type(64bits), all input images have to have same pixel size 

Applied parellel processing by OpenMP : computation performance depends on the number of processing cores.

How to excute the software on unity
1.get interative job with multiple nodes as many as you can for speed up
	qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=48,mem=50GB
2.excute the job script after modifying input images and output path
	./example.sh
3.go to the output path to check the results

4.delete tmp folder in ouput path

Command explanations : Please refer the example.sh job script
	./setsm -Coreg [option1] -image [reference_orthoimage_path] -image [target_orthoimage_path1] -image [target_orthoimage_path2] -outpath [output_path]

	[option1] : 1 for orthoimage, 2 for DEM (future work from matlab version, currently not supported)
	[reference_orthoimage_path] : first input image is the reference.
	[target_orthoimage_path#] : this version supports multiple target orthoimages. Reference and all target images have to include any overlapped area to extract controls and coregistration parameters (dx and dy).

	[output_path] : results
		a. coreg_result.txt : shows orthoimage name, its coregistration parameters, and average correlation(avg_roh)
		b. output_path/txt  : ground control points(GCPs_Image_ID_#_level_#.txt) and coregistration statistics(CoregStat_Image_ID_#_level_#.txt) between reference and target image at each pyramid level
			(1) format of GCPs_Image_ID_#_level_#.txt : reference_X reference_Y target_X target_Y
			(2) format of CoregStat_Image_ID_#_level_#.txt : adjustment_iteration(max:20) target_ID adjustment(dcolumn[pixel]) adjustment(drow[pixel]) Coreg_parameter(column[pixel]) Coreg_parameter(row[pixel]) number_of_controls
